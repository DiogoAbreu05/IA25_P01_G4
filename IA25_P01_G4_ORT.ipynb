    "## Class Timetable (CSP Problem)\n",

    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "> This project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of generating class timetables for the undergraduate courses at the Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave (IPCA).  \n",
    "> Creating timetables is a complex and time-consuming task that involves multiple constraints related to professors, subjects, classrooms, and student groups. Traditionally, this process requires significant time and effort from the administrative team.  \n",
    "> In this context, the project intends to apply Artificial Intelligence techniques, specifically **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**, to automate the creation of viable and optimized timetables, respecting the imposed conditions and minimizing conflicts.  \n",
    "> \n",
    "> The project is implemented in **Python**, using the **Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** (`ortools.sat.python.cp_model`), which provides a powerful and efficient framework for modeling and solving CSPs and combinatorial optimization problems.  \n",
    "> The entire process is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, as per the guidelines of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course.\n",

    "### 2. Goal Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to **design an intelligent agent** capable of automatically generating valid class timetables for undergraduate courses at IPCA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must assign **courses to time slots, rooms, and teachers**, ensuring that no scheduling conflicts occur and that all academic and logistical constraints are satisfied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and Constraints\n",
    "The timetable generation process is subject to several limitations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teacher availability** — each lecturer may have unavailable time slots.  \n",
    "- **Room capacity and restrictions** — some courses must occur in specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- **Course assignment** — each class is associated with a specific set of courses.  \n",
    "- **Online lessons** — some sessions may occur online and not require a physical room.  \n",
    "- **Non-overlapping sessions** — a class, teacher, or room cannot be used in two sessions simultaneously.  \n",
    "- **Class duration** — each lesson lasts 2 hours.  \n",
    "- **Weekly lessons per class** — all classes have 10 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- **Lessons per course** — each course may have 1 or 2 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- **Daily lesson limit** — a class cannot have more than 3 lessons per day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "The system should produce a **valid timetable solution** that:\n",
    "- Assigns every course session to a valid time slot and room.  \n",
    "- Respects all **hard constraints**.  \n",
    "- Minimizes conflicts and overlaps between classes, teachers, and rooms.  \n",
    "- Optionally considers **soft constraints** to improve the quality of the timetable (e.g., minimizing room changes or distributing lessons across the week).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Problem Formulation (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The timetable problem was modeled as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** and solved using the **Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** (`ortools.sat.python.cp_model`).  \n",
    "This solver supports **integer variables**, **Boolean logic**, **complex constraints**, and **custom decision strategies**, making it suitable for this type of scheduling problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "Each **lesson** of a course is represented by a group of integer variables:\n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_slot` — the time slot assigned to that lesson (`IntVar` in range 1–20).  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_room` — the classroom assigned to that lesson (`IntVar` representing room indices).  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_teacher` — the lecturer assigned to that lesson.  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_day` — the day of the week (0–4).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domains\n",
    "- **Time slots:** integers `1–20` (representing sequential periods across Monday–Friday).  \n",
    "- **Rooms:** `{Lab01, Room1, Room2, Online}`, encoded as integer indices.  \n",
    "- **Days:** automatically derived from slots (`(slot − 1) // 4`).  \n",
    "- **Teachers:** integer indices mapped from names.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard Constraints (mandatory):**\n",
    "- Lessons last 2 hours each.  \n",
    "- All classes have 10 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- Each course has 1 or 2 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- Each class can have at most **3 lessons per day**.  \n",
    "- Teachers cannot teach in **unavailable slots** (from dataset).  \n",
    "- **Room restrictions:** certain courses must be assigned to specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- **No overlaps:**  \n",
    "  - Two lessons cannot share the same room and slot.  \n",
    "  - A teacher or class cannot be assigned to two lessons simultaneously.  \n",
    "- **Online courses:** forced to occur in the “Online” room.  \n",
    "- **Non-consecutive lessons:** lessons of the same course are not allowed in consecutive slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft Constraints (preferred):**\n",
    "- Lessons of the same course should be scheduled on different days.  \n",
    "- Classes should ideally use as few different rooms as possible (minimize room changes for teachers and students).  \n",
    "- Classes should have four active days per week if possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Constraints (implemented or optional):\n",
    "- A class may not exceed three lessons per day.  \n",
    "- Online lessons for the same course should occur on the same day when possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve search efficiency, **custom decision strategies** (heuristics) were applied to guide the solver:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable ordering heuristic:**  \n",
    "  The solver uses the **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** strategy (`CHOOSE_MIN_DOMAIN_SIZE`), selecting first the variable with the fewest remaining valid options.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value ordering heuristic:**  \n",
    "  The **Least Constraining Value (LCV)** strategy (`SELECT_MIN_VALUE`) is used, prioritizing assignments that restrict fewer future choices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These heuristics significantly reduce the search space and improve runtime performance.  \n",
    "They are implemented via:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.AddDecisionStrategy(\n",
    "    slot_var_list,\n",
    "    cp_model.CHOOSE_MIN_DOMAIN_SIZE,\n",
    "    cp_model.SELECT_MIN_VALUE\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "and optionally extended with external helpers for configurable heuristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from src.helpers import escolher_heuristica_variaveis, escolher_heuristica_valores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Solution Evaluation and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "During the solving process, all feasible solutions are explored within a maximum time limit (`MAX_TIME_SECONDS = 30`).\n",
    "A custom Solution Collector class (`CpSolverSolutionCallback`) stores each valid solution, evaluates them, and selects the best one according to a soft optimization criterion:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Goal: minimize the number of room changes per teacher across their weekly schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scoring heuristic ensures that teachers’ schedules are more stable and less fragmented.\n",
    "The best-scoring timetable is then exported to a JSON file for further analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Implementation Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation pipeline can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Loading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read dataset from `datasets/timetable_dataset.txt` and extract:\n",

    "**3. Constraint Enforcement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add logical, arithmetic, and “AllDifferent” constraints using OR-Tools API.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**4. Heuristic Configuration:**\n",

    "\n",
    "- Export the best timetable to `outputs/best_schedule.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print summary of variable assignments and performance statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The final system automatically produces valid, conflict-free class timetables that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Respect all hard constraints;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider teachers’ unavailability;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle both in-person and online classes;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize soft criteria (minimize room changes);\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide results within seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the application of Artificial Intelligence — specifically Constraint Programming — to a real-world scheduling problem, effectively reducing manual workload and improving timetable quality.\n",

    "### 9. Critical Analysis and Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1 Critical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The obtained results demonstrate that the constraint model is effective in producing valid and optimized timetables under the given constraints.\n",
    "However, several observations and limitations were identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution diversity** - Although multiple valid schedules were found, many are similar, differing only in minor slot changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution time** - The CP-SAT solver performs well within 30 seconds, but the search space grows exponentially as more courses and teachers are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soft constraint optimization** - The evaluation currently focuses only on minimizing room changes; future versions could include multiple weighted criteria (e.g., consecutive classes, teacher idle time).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Realism** - Some timetables, while valid, might still be impractical (e.g., too many gaps in a day).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2 Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the performance and quality of the agent, the following improvements are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-objective optimization** - Combine several soft constraints with different priorities (e.g., minimize room changes, maximize daily compactness).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adaptive heuristics** - Dynamically adjust heuristics during search (e.g., switch between MRV and randomization).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid approach** - Combine constraint programming with local search (e.g., simulated annealing or genetic algorithms) for post-optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization** - Create a timetable visualization (using matplotlib or a web UI) to make results easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability testing** - Evaluate performance on larger datasets with more teachers, courses, and rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of this project allowed the team to design and implement an **intelligent agent** capable of automatically generating valid and optimized class timetables using **Constraint Programming (CP)** techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, several key insights were gained regarding **problem formulation, constraint modeling, and heuristic optimization**.  \n",
    "The chosen approach — based on the **Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** — proved highly effective for managing complex scheduling requirements, offering both flexibility and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent successfully handled multiple **hard constraints**, such as:\n",
    "- Avoiding overlaps between classes, teachers, and rooms;  \n",
    "- Enforcing teacher availability and room restrictions;  \n",
    "- Respecting daily limits on the number of lessons per class;  \n",
    "- Managing online sessions and lab allocations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the implementation integrated **soft constraints** and a **custom evaluation function** to improve the overall quality of timetables by minimizing room changes and promoting balanced weekly schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development process followed an iterative methodology:\n",
    "1. Initial formulation of the timetable as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**.  \n",
    "2. Incremental integration of new constraints and validation rules.  \n",
    "3. Experimentation with different **heuristics** (MRV and LCV) to optimize solver performance.  \n",
    "4. Implementation of a **custom solution collector** for post-processing and scoring.  \n",
    "5. Export of the final best solution in a structured JSON format for visualization and analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of **Python** and **OR-Tools** proved to be a powerful combination for tackling CSP-based scheduling problems.  \n",
    "Python provided readability and rapid prototyping capabilities, while OR-Tools offered a robust and high-performance constraint solver.  \n",
    "These tools together enabled the creation of a flexible, extensible, and efficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a broader perspective, the project demonstrated the **practical applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques** to real-world problems, such as academic timetable generation — a task traditionally performed manually and prone to conflicts or inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore:\n",
    "- Incorporating **multi-objective optimization** to balance several soft constraints simultaneously;  \n",
    "- Enhancing **solution visualization** through graphical interfaces;  \n",
    "- Integrating **metaheuristic algorithms** (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing) for hybrid optimization;  \n",
    "- Conducting scalability tests with larger datasets to assess solver performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the agent met its objectives by generating valid and optimized timetables that adhere to institutional constraints and preferences.  \n",
    "The project provided valuable experience in **AI problem modeling**, **constraint programming**, and **algorithmic reasoning**, reinforcing the importance of structured approaches in solving combinatorial optimization problems.\n"
