    "## Class Timetable (CSP Problem)\n",

    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "> This project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of generating class timetables for the undergraduate courses at the Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave (IPCA).  \n",
    "> Creating timetables is a complex and time-consuming task that involves multiple constraints related to professors, subjects, classrooms, and student groups. Traditionally, this process requires significant time and effort from the administrative team.  \n",
    "> In this context, the project intends to apply Artificial Intelligence techniques, specifically **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**, to automate the creation of viable and optimized timetables, respecting the imposed conditions and minimizing conflicts.  \n",
    "> \n",
    "> The project is implemented in **Python**, using the **Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** (`ortools.sat.python.cp_model`), which provides a powerful and efficient framework for modeling and solving CSPs and combinatorial optimization problems.  \n",
    "> The entire process is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, as per the guidelines of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course.\n",

    "### 2. Goal Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to **design an intelligent agent** capable of automatically generating valid class timetables for undergraduate courses at IPCA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must assign **courses to time slots, rooms, and teachers**, ensuring that no scheduling conflicts occur and that all academic and logistical constraints are satisfied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and Constraints\n",
    "The timetable generation process is subject to several limitations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teacher availability** — each lecturer may have unavailable time slots.  \n",
    "- **Room capacity and restrictions** — some courses must occur in specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- **Course assignment** — each class is associated with a specific set of courses.  \n",
    "- **Online lessons** — some sessions may occur online and not require a physical room.  \n",
    "- **Non-overlapping sessions** — a class, teacher, or room cannot be used in two sessions simultaneously.  \n",
    "- **Class duration** — each lesson lasts 2 hours.  \n",
    "- **Weekly lessons per class** — all classes have 10 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- **Lessons per course** — each course may have 1 or 2 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- **Daily lesson limit** — a class cannot have more than 3 lessons per day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "The system should produce a **valid timetable solution** that:\n",
    "- Assigns every course session to a valid time slot and room.  \n",
    "- Respects all **hard constraints**.  \n",
    "- Minimizes conflicts and overlaps between classes, teachers, and rooms.  \n",
    "- Optionally considers **soft constraints** to improve the quality of the timetable (e.g., minimizing room changes or distributing lessons across the week).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Problem Formulation (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The timetable problem was modeled as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** and solved using the **Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** (`ortools.sat.python.cp_model`).  \n",
    "This solver supports **integer variables**, **Boolean logic**, **complex constraints**, and **custom decision strategies**, making it suitable for this type of scheduling problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "Each **lesson** of a course is represented by a group of integer variables:\n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_slot` — the time slot assigned to that lesson (`IntVar` in range 1–20).  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_room` — the classroom assigned to that lesson (`IntVar` representing room indices).  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_teacher` — the lecturer assigned to that lesson.  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_day` — the day of the week (0–4).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domains\n",
    "- **Time slots:** integers `1–20` (representing sequential periods across Monday–Friday).  \n",
    "- **Rooms:** `{Lab01, Room1, Room2, Online}`, encoded as integer indices.  \n",
    "- **Days:** automatically derived from slots (`(slot − 1) // 4`).  \n",
    "- **Teachers:** integer indices mapped from names.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard Constraints (mandatory):**\n",
    "- Lessons last 2 hours each.  \n",
    "- All classes have 10 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- Each course has 1 or 2 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- Each class can have at most **3 lessons per day**.  \n",
    "- Teachers cannot teach in **unavailable slots** (from dataset).  \n",
    "- **Room restrictions:** certain courses must be assigned to specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- **No overlaps:**  \n",
    "  - Two lessons cannot share the same room and slot.  \n",
    "  - A teacher or class cannot be assigned to two lessons simultaneously.  \n",
    "- **Online courses:** forced to occur in the “Online” room.  \n",
    "- **Non-consecutive lessons:** lessons of the same course are not allowed in consecutive slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft Constraints (preferred):**\n",
    "- Lessons of the same course should be scheduled on different days.  \n",
    "- Classes should ideally use as few different rooms as possible (minimize room changes for teachers and students).  \n",
    "- Classes should have four active days per week if possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Constraints (implemented or optional):\n",
    "- A class may not exceed three lessons per day.  \n",
    "- Online lessons for the same course should occur on the same day when possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve search efficiency, **custom decision strategies** (heuristics) were applied to guide the solver:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable ordering heuristic:**  \n",
    "  The solver uses the **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** strategy (`CHOOSE_MIN_DOMAIN_SIZE`), selecting first the variable with the fewest remaining valid options.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value ordering heuristic:**  \n",
    "  The **Least Constraining Value (LCV)** strategy (`SELECT_MIN_VALUE`) is used, prioritizing assignments that restrict fewer future choices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These heuristics significantly reduce the search space and improve runtime performance.  \n",
    "They are implemented via:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.AddDecisionStrategy(\n",
    "    slot_var_list,\n",
    "    cp_model.CHOOSE_MIN_DOMAIN_SIZE,\n",
    "    cp_model.SELECT_MIN_VALUE\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "and optionally extended with external helpers for configurable heuristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from src.helpers import escolher_heuristica_variaveis, escolher_heuristica_valores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Solution Evaluation and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "During the solving process, all feasible solutions are explored within a maximum time limit (`MAX_TIME_SECONDS = 30`).\n",
    "A custom Solution Collector class (`CpSolverSolutionCallback`) stores each valid solution, evaluates them, and selects the best one according to a soft optimization criterion:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Goal: minimize the number of room changes per teacher across their weekly schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scoring heuristic ensures that teachers’ schedules are more stable and less fragmented.\n",
    "The best-scoring timetable is then exported to a JSON file for further analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Implementation Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation pipeline can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Loading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read dataset from `datasets/timetable_dataset.txt` and extract:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Apply domain and constraint definitions programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Constraint Enforcement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add logical, arithmetic, and “AllDifferent” constraints using OR-Tools API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guarantee class, teacher, and room consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Heuristic Configuration:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**6. Output Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Export the best timetable to `outputs/best_schedule.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print summary of variable assignments and performance statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The final system automatically produces valid, conflict-free class timetables that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Respect all hard constraints;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider teachers’ unavailability;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle both in-person and online classes;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimize soft criteria (minimize room changes);\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide results within seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the application of Artificial Intelligence — specifically Constraint Programming — to a real-world scheduling problem, effectively reducing manual workload and improving timetable quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 9.1 Critical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The obtained results demonstrate that the constraint model is effective in producing valid and optimized timetables under the given constraints.\n",
    "However, several observations and limitations were identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution diversity** - Although multiple valid schedules were found, many are similar, differing only in minor slot changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution time** - The CP-SAT solver performs well within 30 seconds, but the search space grows exponentially as more courses and teachers are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soft constraint optimization** - The evaluation currently focuses only on minimizing room changes; future versions could include multiple weighted criteria (e.g., consecutive classes, teacher idle time).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Realism** - Some timetables, while valid, might still be impractical (e.g., too many gaps in a day).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2 Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the performance and quality of the agent, the following improvements are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-objective optimization** - Combine several soft constraints with different priorities (e.g., minimize room changes, maximize daily compactness).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adaptive heuristics** - Dynamically adjust heuristics during search (e.g., switch between MRV and randomization).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid approach** - Combine constraint programming with local search (e.g., simulated annealing or genetic algorithms) for post-optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization** - Create a timetable visualization (using matplotlib or a web UI) to make results easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability testing** - Evaluate performance on larger datasets with more teachers, courses, and rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of this project allowed the team to design and implement an **intelligent agent** capable of automatically generating valid and optimized class timetables using **Constraint Programming (CP)** techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, several key insights were gained regarding **problem formulation, constraint modeling, and heuristic optimization**.  \n",
    "The chosen approach — based on the **Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** — proved highly effective for managing complex scheduling requirements, offering both flexibility and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent successfully handled multiple **hard constraints**, such as:\n",
    "- Avoiding overlaps between classes, teachers, and rooms;  \n",
    "- Enforcing teacher availability and room restrictions;  \n",
    "- Respecting daily limits on the number of lessons per class;  \n",
    "- Managing online sessions and lab allocations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the implementation integrated **soft constraints** and a **custom evaluation function** to improve the overall quality of timetables by minimizing room changes and promoting balanced weekly schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development process followed an iterative methodology:\n",
    "1. Initial formulation of the timetable as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**.  \n",
