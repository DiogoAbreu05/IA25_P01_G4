    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "> This project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of generating class timetables for the undergraduate courses at the Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave (IPCA).  \n",
    "> Creating timetables is a complex and time-consuming task that involves multiple constraints related to professors, subjects, classrooms, and student groups. Traditionally, this process requires significant time and effort from the administrative team.  \n",
    "> In this context, the project intends to apply Artificial Intelligence techniques, specifically Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), to automate the creation of viable and optimized timetables, respecting the imposed conditions and minimizing conflicts.  \n",
    "> The project will be implemented in Python, using the `python-constraint` library, and fully documented in a Jupyter Notebook, as per the guidelines of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course.\n",

    "### 2. Goal Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to **design an intelligent agent** capable of automatically generating valid class timetables for undergraduate courses at IPCA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must assign **courses to time slots and rooms**, ensuring that no scheduling conflicts occur and that all academic and logistical constraints are satisfied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and Constraints\n",
    "The timetable generation process is subject to several limitations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teacher availability** — each lecturer may have unavailable time slots.  \n",
    "- **Room capacity and restrictions** — some courses must occur in specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- **Course assignment** — each class is associated with a specific set of courses.  \n",
    "- **Online lessons** — some sessions may occur online and not require a physical room.  \n",
    "- **Non-overlapping sessions** — a class, teacher, or room cannot be used in two sessions simultaneously.  \n",
    "- **Class duration** — each lesson lasts 2 hours.  \n",
    "- **Weekly lessons per class** — all classes have 10 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- **Lessons per course** — each course may have 1 or 2 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- **Daily lesson limit** — a class cannot have more than 3 lessons per day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "The system should produce a **valid timetable solution** that:\n",
    "- Assigns every course session to a valid time slot and room.  \n",
    "- Respects all **hard constraints**.  \n",
    "- Minimizes conflicts and overlaps between classes and teachers.  \n",
    "- Optionally considers **soft constraints** to optimize the timetable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Problem Formulation (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The timetable problem was modeled as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** using the `python-constraint` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "Each **lesson** of a course is represented by two variables:\n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_slot` — the time slot assigned to that lesson.  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_room` — the classroom assigned to that lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domains\n",
    "- **Time slots:** `1–20` (representing possible periods in the week).  \n",
    "- **Rooms:** `{Lab01, Room1, Room2}`, unless specific restrictions apply.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard Constraints (mandatory):**\n",
    "- Classes last 2 hours.  \n",
    "- All classes have 10 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- Each course may have 1 or 2 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- A class cannot have more than 3 lessons per day.  \n",
    "- Teacher availability — a course cannot be scheduled in time slots where its lecturer is unavailable.  \n",
    "- Room restrictions — some courses are restricted to specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- No overlapping classes — no class, teacher, or room can appear in two lessons at the same time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft Constraints (preferred, can be violated if necessary):**\n",
    "- Lessons of the same course must be scheduled on distinct days.  \n",
    "- Each class should have only four days of lessons per week.  \n",
    "- Lessons within the same day should be consecutive. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Constraints (optional improvements)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard Constraints (additional):**\n",
    "- When online classes are scheduled, limited to a maximum of three per course, they must be scheduled on the same day.  \n",
    "- Some classes are required to be assigned to a specific classroom (already partly implemented via `roomrestrictions`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft Constraints (additional):**\n",
    "- The number of classrooms used by each class should be minimized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heuristics\n",
    "The CSP solver may apply **variable ordering heuristics** (e.g., most constrained variable first) and **domain reduction** to improve efficiency.  \n",
    "Further heuristics (e.g., least constraining value) may be explored in later iterations.\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "> The implementation is based on the `python-constraint` library.  \n",
    "> The dataset is read from `datasets/timetable_dataset.txt`, and constraints are dynamically built from the data.  \n",
    "> Below is the initial implementation of the CSP model:\n",
