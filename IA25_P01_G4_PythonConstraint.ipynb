    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "> This project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of generating class timetables for the undergraduate courses at the Polytechnic Institute of CÃ¡vado and Ave (IPCA).  \n",
    "> Timetable creation is a challenging and time-consuming task involving multiple constraints related to teachers, classrooms, and courses. Traditionally, this process requires significant manual effort and coordination.  \n",
    "> \n",
    "> In this project, Artificial Intelligence techniques â€” specifically **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)** â€” are applied to automate the generation of valid and conflict-free timetables.  \n",
    "> \n",
    "> The implementation is done in **Python**, using the **`python-constraint`** library, which provides a high-level API for defining variables, domains, and constraints in CSP problems.  \n",
    "> The entire process is documented in a Jupyter Notebook as required by the Artificial Intelligence course guidelines.\n",

    "### 2. Goal Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to **design a CSP-based intelligent agent** that automatically generates valid class timetables for IPCAâ€™s undergraduate programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must assign **courses to time slots, rooms, and teachers**, ensuring that no scheduling conflicts occur and that all academic and logistical restrictions are respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and Constraints\n",
    "The timetable generation process is subject to multiple restrictions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teacher availability** â€” each teacher may have unavailable time slots.  \n",
    "- **Room capacity and restrictions** â€” certain courses must take place in specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- **Course-to-class assignments** â€” each class is linked to a specific set of courses.  \n",
    "- **Online sessions** â€” some lessons occur online and do not require a physical room.  \n",
    "- **Non-overlapping lessons** â€” a class, teacher, or room cannot be assigned to two lessons simultaneously.  \n",
    "- **Lesson duration** â€” each session lasts 2 hours.  \n",
    "- **Weekly limit** â€” each class has 10 lessons per week.  \n",
    "- **Daily limit** â€” a class may have at most 3 lessons per day.  \n",
    "- **Non-consecutive lessons** â€” lessons of the same course cannot be scheduled in consecutive slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results\n",
    "The system should produce a **valid timetable** that:\n",
    "- Assigns all courses to valid time slots and rooms.  \n",
    "- Satisfies all **hard constraints**.  \n",
    "- Avoids overlapping sessions and consecutive slots for the same class.  \n",
    "- Handles both **in-person** and **online** sessions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Problem Formulation (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was modeled as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** using the `python-constraint` library.  \n",
    "This library allows the definition of variables (with finite domains) and constraints (logical or functional) that the solver must satisfy simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "Each **lesson** of each **course** is represented by a group of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_slot` â€” the time slot assigned to that lesson (`1â€“20`).  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_room` â€” the assigned classroom (`Lab01`, `Room1`, `Room2`, or `Online`).  \n",
    "- `<course>_<lesson>_teacher` â€” the lecturer responsible for the course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domains\n",
    "- **Time slots:** integers from `1â€“20` (4 per day, across Mondayâ€“Friday).  \n",
    "- **Rooms:** `[\"Lab01\", \"Room1\", \"Room2\", \"Online\"]`, restricted when necessary.  \n",
    "- **Teachers:** mapped automatically from the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard Constraints (mandatory):**\n",
    "- **Teacher availability:** lessons cannot be scheduled in teachersâ€™ unavailable slots.  \n",
    "- **Room restrictions:** some courses must occur in specific rooms (e.g., labs).  \n",
    "- **Online classes:** lessons marked as online must be assigned to the \"Online\" room.  \n",
    "- **No overlapping:**  \n",
    "  - A class cannot have two lessons in the same time slot.  \n",
    "  - A teacher cannot teach two classes at the same time.  \n",
    "- **No consecutive lessons:** two lessons of the same class or in the same room cannot be consecutive.  \n",
    "- **Daily limit:** no more than three lessons per day for any class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft Constraints (optional / improvement goals):**\n",
    "- Avoid scheduling multiple lessons of the same course on the same day.  \n",
    "- Distribute lessons evenly throughout the week.  \n",
    "- Minimize room changes when possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Heuristics and Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The `python-constraint` library internally uses backtracking with constraint propagation to find valid solutions.  \n",
    "Although it does not provide explicit heuristic control (like MRV or LCV), the project indirectly improves performance by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reducing variable domains where possible (e.g., applying room and teacher restrictions).  \n",
    "- Structuring constraints pairwise to prune inconsistent assignments early.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The solver searches for the **first valid solution** that satisfies all constraints.  \n",
    "If multiple valid solutions exist, the first one found is exported for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Solution Evaluation and Export\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a valid timetable is found, it is stored and formatted as a structured **JSON** file (`outputs/best_schedule.json`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each lesson is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"UC11_1\": {\n",
    "    \"slot\": 5,\n",
    "    \"room\": \"Room2\",\n",
    "    \"teacher\": \"jo\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output JSON is sorted by course code for easier visualization.\n",
    "Execution time is measured to evaluate solver efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Implementation Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation pipeline can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Dataset Import**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reads input from `datasets/timetable_dataset.txt`, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class-to-course mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Course-to-teacher assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time slot restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Room restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Online class flags\n",
    "\n",
    "If no dataset is found, the script loads simulated data to ensure continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Variable Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each course and lesson, variables are created for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slot (`1â€“20`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Room (restricted or general)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Teacher (from dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Constraint Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pairwise constraints to prevent consecutive lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `AllDifferentConstraint()` to avoid slot overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logical constraints for teacher unavailability and room usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom function `max_three_lessons_per_day()` ensures the daily limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Solving Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CSP is solved using `problem.getSolution()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution time is logged for performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Output Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting timetable is serialized into JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "If writing fails, the solution is printed to the console as fallback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The final system automatically generates valid, conflict-free timetables that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Respect all **hard constraints** (availability, room usage, no overlaps).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle both **physical and online** classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prevent consecutive and overloaded days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce consistent JSON outputs ready for visualization or further optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how **Constraint Satisfaction Programming** using the `python-constraint` library can effectively solve real-world scheduling problems with compact and readable Python code.\n",

    "### 9. Critical Analysis and Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1 Critical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The obtained results demonstrate that the constraint-based model developed with the `python-constraint` library is effective in producing **valid and conflict-free timetables** that comply with all defined rules and restrictions.  \n",
    "Nevertheless, several **limitations and improvement opportunities** were identified during testing and analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution diversity** â€” While the solver can generate multiple valid solutions, many are structurally similar, differing only in minor time slot variations. This is due to the backtracking nature of the solver, which stops after finding the first valid configuration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution time** â€” For small to medium datasets, the system performs efficiently. However, the **search space increases exponentially** with additional classes, courses, and teachers, which can impact performance for larger datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soft constraint handling** â€” The current implementation focuses primarily on hard constraints. There is no optimization function for soft preferences such as minimizing room changes or teacher idle times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of heuristic customization** â€” Unlike solvers such as OR-Tools, `python-constraint` does not support advanced heuristics (e.g., MRV or LCV), which limits fine-tuned control over the search order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practicality and realism** â€” Although all constraints are respected, some valid timetables may still be less practical (e.g., scattered lessons or excessive daily gaps).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2 Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the overall quality, scalability, and realism of the system, the following improvements are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-objective optimization**  \n",
    "   Introduce custom scoring or ranking mechanisms to evaluate and choose between multiple valid solutions, considering soft constraints such as compactness, fairness, and balance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Post-processing optimization**  \n",
    "   Apply metaheuristic or local search techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, hill climbing, or genetic algorithms) to improve the first valid solution produced by the CSP solver.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partial randomization and heuristics**  \n",
    "   Implement randomized or heuristic-based variable selection to diversify search paths and avoid repetitive solution patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization and user interface**  \n",
    "   Develop a timetable visualization tool (e.g., using `matplotlib` or a web interface) to display the generated schedules in a clear and intuitive manner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability and stress testing**  \n",
    "   Test the system on larger datasets with multiple classes, teachers, and time slots to assess solver performance and identify optimization bottlenecks.  \n",
    "\n",

    "### 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully designed and implemented an **intelligent agent** capable of automatically generating valid academic timetables using **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** techniques and the **`python-constraint`** library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the development process, the team gained valuable insights into **constraint modeling, problem decomposition, and solution validation** within a combinatorial scheduling context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent effectively managed multiple **hard constraints**, including:\n",
    "- Preventing overlaps between classes, teachers, and rooms;  \n",
    "- Enforcing teacher availability restrictions;  \n",
    "- Managing room assignments and lab requirements;  \n",
    "- Handling online course scheduling;  \n",
    "- Ensuring that no class exceeds three lessons per day;  \n",
    "- Avoiding consecutive lessons within the same class or room.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation followed a modular and data-driven pipeline:\n",
    "1. Dataset import and preprocessing.  \n",
    "2. Definition of CSP variables and domains.  \n",
    "3. Application of logical and functional constraints.  \n",
    "4. Solving using `python-constraint`â€™s backtracking approach.  \n",
    "5. Export of valid timetables to structured JSON format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of **Python** and the **`python-constraint`** library proved to be a simple yet effective approach for solving scheduling problems.  \n",
    "While it lacks advanced heuristic control and optimization capabilities present in solvers like OR-Tools, it offers **high readability, rapid prototyping**, and easy constraint definition â€” ideal for educational and small-to-medium problem scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a broader perspective, this project highlights the **practical applicability of Artificial Intelligence** to administrative and operational challenges such as academic scheduling.  \n",
    "By leveraging constraint programming, the team was able to automate a traditionally manual process, reducing the potential for human error and improving timetable consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore:\n",
    "- Incorporating **multi-objective optimization** for balancing soft constraints;  \n",
    "- Enhancing the **user interface** for visualization and manual adjustment;  \n",
    "- Integrating **metaheuristic methods** for hybrid optimization;  \n",
    "- Conducting **large-scale performance tests** to assess solver scalability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the agent successfully achieved its goal of generating **valid, rule-compliant, and adaptable timetables**.  \n",
    "The project provided hands-on experience in **AI-based constraint reasoning**, reinforcing the importance of structured modeling in solving complex scheduling and resource allocation problems."
